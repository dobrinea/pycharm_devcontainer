# Installation and Usage

## Install the dependencies

This project itself is just the template, but you need to install these tools to use it:

- Linux<sup>1</sup>
- [copier][]
- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/)
  - [Compose V2 plugin](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)
- [git](https://git-scm.com/) 2.24 or newer
- [invoke](https://www.pyinvoke.org/) installed in Python 3.8.1+ (and the binary must be
  called `invoke` â€” beware if your distro installs it as `invoke3` or similar).
- [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/)
- [python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8.1+
- [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)

Install non-python apps with your distro's recommended package manager. The recommended
way to install Python CLI apps is [pipx](https://pipxproject.github.io/pipx/):

```bash
python3 -m pip install --user pipx
pipx install copier
pipx install invoke
pipx install pre-commit
pipx ensurepath
```

## Use the template to generate your subproject

Once you installed everything, you can now use Copier to copy this template:

```bash
copier copy gh:Tecnativa/doodba-copier-template ~/path/to/your/subproject
```

Copier will ask you a lot of questions. Answer them to properly generate the template.

Notes:

- The backup service will not be deployed when using postgresql 9.6.

<sup>1</sup> Any modern distro should work. Ubuntu and Fedora are officially supported.
Other systems are not tested. If you're on Windows, you'll probably need WSL or a Linux
VM to work with ERPDev without problems. If you use other systems and find a way to make
these tools work, please consider [opening a PR](#contributing) to add some docs that
might help others with your situation.
